==============

In this section will be describe the main entry points to the CSS module.
The CSS features are mainly in a web framework dedicated to change the display of the page.

This will then be very useful to add style to your page. Colors, layout, size... everything visible on the page will be
done using CSS fragments. In a traditional web page, CSS can be defined and isolated in text files .css and this can
be changed on the HTML components or the JavaScript layer.

Each component in the framework will embed some CSS information in various forms. This section will
introduce the different way to define CSS but also to change it. Any function in the framework is documented and should
allow you to enrich your knowledge on it with the useful Pages.

This framework is very linked to most of the Web concepts and all the documentation used to build and design it have
been added to the functions documentation so do not hesitate to have a look at it.

Also as this is a collaborative project to not hesitate to push comments in order to help onboarding users and
improving the framework quality.
